This project is a single page weather app that a user can input the name of a city and see the weather for that city in real time. The weather information for the city will be taken at the current time of input and generated on the page dynamically. The current weather for the city on that day will be the main focus of the page while the following 5 day forecast will be available as complimentary data. When the user searches for a city, that city will be kept as a previous search on the page that can then be accessed again at any point to reference weather data.
